## TO PLAN:
1. Start planning up how to structure the dataset. What do I need? Database? SQL? Something else?
2. Start thinking about page structure. What would be the best approach for navigating the data?
3. Start looking into how to bind buttons to functions in JavaScript so that you can retrieve data dynamically for the Dash.

## TO DO:
1. Code structure improvements still needed in utils_ConvertAll_csv.py.
2. Update README.md to fill out project goals.
3. Spin up Dash and Plotly for exploring data visually.
4. Add code prerequisites in the README.

## DONE:
1. Implemented multithreading in utils_ConvertAll_csv.py for a huge performance uplift.
2. Added monthly data file handling for csv conversion. The data's file structure differs from the daily, hourly, and subhourly, so that had to be taken into consideration.
3. Spin up Dash and Plotly for exploring data visually.
